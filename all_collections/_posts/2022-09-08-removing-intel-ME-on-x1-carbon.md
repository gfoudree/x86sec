# Intel Management Engine (ME) Removal 
<hr>

## Getting existing firmware

The ME firmware is bundled as part of the UEFI firmware on a computer, so we must obtain a copy of the existing UEFI firmware first. It might be possible to download a BIOS bundle from Lenovo's website, but to ensure success I decided to just read it directly from the BIOS chip on my laptop.

There are several ways to read the BIOS chip, I chose to use an inexpensive ($13) [CH341A USB programmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908183748/https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-SOIC8-EEPROM-CH341A-Programmer/dp/B07SHSL9X9) which comes with a nice 8-pin SOIC clip so nothing has to be desoldered. You can use anything that will run SPI commands (Buspirate, RPI, etc...).

Next we have to locate the BIOS chip on the motherboard. Typically, it is an 8-pin chip made by "Winbond" and if you lookup the part number it will be an SPI flash chip. On the X1 Carbon 6th gen, it is located under a sticker and the part number is `W25Q128JV`. From the datasheet we can see it is a 3.3V, 128M-Bit SPI Serial Flash chip. (The BIOS programmer does not list it as supported, but it works fine).

![winbondchip](/assets/winbond_chip.webp "Windbond Chip")

Attach the SOIC clip with the RED cable oriented in the corner of the chip that has the circle on it then attach the header into the top part of the ZIF socket (25 BIOS section) and align it as such:

![programmerchip](/assets/progrmamer_chip.jpeg "Programmer chip")

At this point, you should be able to read from the chip. We want to make a backup so we can restore the old BIOS if we break anything (and we will `:)`). If `flashrom` gives you an error, try fiddling with the clip and making sure it is attached properly.

```bash
└─$ flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -r backup.bin    
flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.4.0-125-generic (x86_64)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org

Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q128.V" (16384 kB, SPI) on ch341a_spi.
Reading flash... done.
```

**To be _extra_ safe, run the above command a couple more times to make extra backups and then verify the checksum (SHA512) is the _same_ across all of them. Sometimes a bad read might occur because the clip unseats, etc... and the last thing you want is a corrupted backup image.**

## Using me_cleaner

Download [me_cleaner](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner) which we will use to disable/remove the Intel ME from the extracted firmware.

There's two main modes you can run `me_cleaner` with - remove as many ME components as possible, or set the HAP bit and ask ME to disable itself. We will start by trying the first option and removing most of the ME code.

```bash
└─$ python3 me_cleaner.py -S -O cleaned.bin ../../backup.bin

It looks like it succeeded, great! Now let's flash the modified BIOS firmware back to the BIOS chip.

```bash
└─$ flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -w Downloads/me_cleaner/cleaned.bin

Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q128.V" (16384 kB, SPI) on ch341a_spi.

```

Now, let's disconnect the clip and power on the laptop... And we get a bunch of musical tones playing and a black screen. Great. It looks like this has removed some component that will not allow the laptop to boot. Restoring the backup firmware works fine and the laptop powers on without issues. Time for plan B...


## Setting the HAP bit

There is an undocumented setting (supposedly there for US Govermental agencies to use on sensitive devices) called the "High Assurance Platform" bit which tells the ME to disable itself. `me_cleaner` can be used to set this in our BIOS firmware - let's go ahead and give it a try:



```bash
└─$ python3 me_cleaner.py -s -O cleaned_soft.bin ../../backup.bin

Full image detected
Found FPT header at 0x3010
Found 13 partition(s)
Found FTPR header: FTPR partition spans from 0x1000 to 0x130000
Found FTPR manifest at 0x1478

Public key match: Intel ME, firmware versions 11.x.x.x
The HAP bit is NOT SET
Setting the HAP bit in PCHSTRP0 to disable Intel ME...
Checking the FTPR RSA signature... VALID
Done! Good luck!
```

Flashing this version back to the board works great and the laptop powers right up without any issues!

## Checking if the ME has been disabled/removed

There are several ways we can try and check if the ME has been disabled. [MEI AMT Check](https://github.com/mjg59/mei-amt-check) will tell us if AMT is working (part of the ME) and running it appears like it is disabled. So far so good :)


```bash
└─$ sudo ./mei-amt-check
Unable to find a Management Engine interface - run sudo modprobe mei_me and retry.
If you receive the same error, this system does not have AMT
```

Next, let's try [Coreboot's tool to check](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/Get-the-status-of-Intel-ME). There's an error at the top (but some forums say to ignore it) and it too reports it can't find the PCI device presented by the ME.


```bash
└─$ sudo ./intelmetool -d -m                                                                                        
Bad news, you have a `Sunrise Point LPC Controller/eSPI Controller` so you have ME hardware on board and you can't control or disable it, continuing...

ME PCI device is hidden
RCBA addr: 0x00000000
Can't find ME PCI device
```

Intel also has a ME version checker tool which also reports an issue talking to the ME.

```bash
└─$ sudo ./intel_csme_version_detection_tool --help

Finally, let's see if the BIOS configuration page has any details:

![biossettings](/assets/bios_settings.jpeg)

We can see that no version of the ME is detected! All 4 separate methods all report the ME as inaccessible/disabled which leads me to believe setting the HAP bit was successful in disabling it.
